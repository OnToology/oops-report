# OOPS Report

![OOPS!](http://vocab.linkeddata.es/ontologies/oops/logomini.png)

The following evaluation results have been generated by the [RESTFul web service](http://oops-ws.oeg-upm.net/) provided by [OOPS!](http://oops.linkeddata.es/) (OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner!).

It is obvious that not all the pitfalls are equally important; their impact in the ontology will depend on multiple factors. For this reason, each pitfall has an importance level attached indicating how important it is. We have identified three levels:

![critical](critical.png) It is crucial to correct the pitfall. Otherwise, it could affect the ontology consistency, reasoning, applicability, etc.
![important](important.png) Though not critical for ontology function, it is important to correct this type of pitfall.
![minor](minor.png) It is not really a problem, but by correcting it we will make the ontology nicer.




### Pitfalls

- P22. Using different naming conventions in the ontology. ![minor](minor.png) 1 cases detected.
*The ontology elements are not named following the same convention (for example CamelCase or use of delimiters as "-" or "_") . Some notions about naming conventions are provided in [2].*

- P05. Defining wrong inverse relationships2 cases detected. ![critical](critical.png) (2 cases detected).
*Two relationships are defined as inverse relations when they are not necessarily inverse.*
