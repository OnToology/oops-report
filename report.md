The following evaluation results have been generated by the [RESTFul web service](http://oops-ws.oeg-upm.net/) provided by [OOPS!](http://oops.linkeddata.es/) (OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner!).

It is obvious that not all the pitfalls are equally important; their impact in the ontology will depend on multiple factors. For this reason, each pitfall has an importance level attached indicating how important it is. We have identified three levels:


<img src="critical.png" height="15px"> It is crucial to correct the pitfall. Otherwise, it could affect the ontology consistency, reasoning, applicability, etc.

<img src="important.png" height="15px"> Though not critical for ontology function, it is important to correct this type of pitfall.

<img src="minor.png" height="15px"> It is not really a problem, but by correcting it we will make the ontology nicer.
